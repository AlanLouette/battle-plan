# Battle plan | Alan Louette

**First week**

I have worked with Wordpress during my formation last year but I want to rework on it. I have forgotten a bit but I want to perform and to learn new things. It can be very useful for me to find a  job more easily.

**Second week**

I want to improve a lot with mySQL and database. It's still very hard for me because I don't understand a lot this domain, but I definitely want to improve because it's a huge part of web develoment and it can be unfavorable if I can't use database. 

It can takes 2 weeks if im still struggling

**The week after**

I will work on React and read my project again to undestand what has been done by my friends and to understant at 100% what we have done with React.

**After summer break**

I still don't know what I will do after yet.
