# Battle plan | Alan Louette

**First two weeks**

I have worked with Wordpress during my formation last year but I want to rework on it. I have forgotten a bit but I want to perform and to learn new things. It can be very useful for me to find a job more easily.

I want to improve a lot with mySQL and database. It's still very hard for me because I don't understand a lot this domain, but I definitely want to improve because it's a huge part of web develoment and it can be unfavorable if I can't use database. So I will make a small project by combining Wordpress and mySQL.

It can takes 3 weeks if im still struggling

**The week after**

I will work on React and read my project again to undestand what has been done by my friends and to understand at 100% what we have done with React. I think I will use again mySQL.


**First week after summer break**

I will work on a little project with Wordpress the first fews weeks while searching for my job.
